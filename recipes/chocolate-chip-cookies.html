    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/4 cups of flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>3/4 cups of brown sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cups of sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Two sticks of butter</li>
        <li>Two eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. This can be done by hand or with an electric mixer.</li>
        <li>Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each is fully incorporated before adding the next. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in dense cookies.</li>
        <li>Gently fold in the chocolate chips, distributing them evenly throughout the dough.</li>
        <li>Using a tablespoon or cookie scoop, drop rounded portions of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. For a more uniform shape, you can roll the dough into balls.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges turn a golden brown color. The centers may still appear slightly soft but will firm up as the cookies cool.</li>
        <li>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. This will help them retain their shape and develop a delightful crispiness.</li>
        <li>Serve the cookies fresh and enjoy their irresistible combination of crispy edges and a gooey chocolate center. These cookies can be stored in an airtight container for up to a week, although it's unlikely they'll last that long!</li>
